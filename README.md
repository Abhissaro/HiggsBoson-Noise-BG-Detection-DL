# Deep_learning-Binary-Classification

The following project is a binary Classification problem solved using a simple Deep Learning model. Techniques like Imputating with mean values, standard scaling and feature selection using chi - square have been used to improve the model performance. The ipynb notebook along with the python code for deployment in streamlit have also been provided for reference. 


The Higgs boson is the fundamental particle associated with the Higgs field, a field that gives mass to other fundamental particles such as electrons and quarks.

A particleâ€™s mass determines how much it resists changing its speed or position when it encounters a force. Not all fundamental particles have mass.

The photon, which is the particle of light and carries the electromagnetic force, has no mass at all.

Higgs boson is a fundamental particle, and the classification of Higgs signals is a well-known problem in high energy physics. The identification of the Higgs signal is a challenging task because its signal has a resemblance to the background signals, using a deep neural network to build a robust and generalized Higgs boson prediction system to discriminate the Higgs signal from the background noise.
Dataset Details:-

Dataset of 250000 events, with an ID column, 30 feature columns, a weight column and a label column.

This is a classification problem in which 'Label' is a target variable, we have to predict signal or background noise
