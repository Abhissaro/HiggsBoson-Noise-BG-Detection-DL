# Deep_learning-Binary-Classification

The following project is a binary Classification problem solved using a simple Deep Learning model. Techniques like Imputating with mean values, standard scaling and feature selection using chi - square have been used to improve the model performance. The ipynb notebook along with the python code for deployment in streamlit have also been provided for reference.
